# dcgan-skyrogue

This is my on-going effort to train an RL algorithm to play the steam game Skyrogue. I'm currently working on using supervised learning to build an "agent controller" that would provide hand-crafted rewards to an agent as well as preventing the agent from closing a running game.

This project uses my GameHarness project to turn running X11 apps into environments for agents.
